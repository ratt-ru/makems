      <P>The aim of this challenge is to repeat some of the challenges but "observing" with an instrument other than the WSRT. A python program is included which can generate antenna tables for many well know arrays, as well as any combination of the dishes contained in the included antenna data file.</P>
      <P>This antenna table can then be used with makems to generate the measurement set. Instructions for getting makems are here: http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki/BuildingMakeMs</P>
      <P>This program has only been tested with the version of pyrap from the oxford repository.</P>
