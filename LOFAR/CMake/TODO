==============================================================================

* Solve the CN and ION build problems for RTCP. These problems arise because
  CN and ION are now defined as variants, whereas they should be defined as
  different compilers.
  However, this only solves part of the problem. A *real* solution is to
  define compilers in separate <compiler-suite>.compiler.conf files. That
  way we can do per-compiler settings, instead of per-host settings, using a
  variants file (see bug #1395).

* Python package are not yet part of the CMake build.

* In order for SubSystem build to succeed, it is necessary that meta-packages
  can be used as a real target -- so that you can "make LCS" to build all LCS
  packages -- much like the lofarconf.in file do in the Autotools environment.
  Specifying the packages as dependencies using lofar_add_package() will
  not work, because then these packages cannot be optional. Maybe we should
  change the semantics of lofar_add_package() to something that is now
  handled by lofar_add_subdirectory(); and have a new macro, e.g. 
  set_package_dependencies(), that can be used to define the actual package
  dependencies. 

* Define ${PROJECT_NAME}_LINK_LIBRARIES in LofarAddPackage.cmake, which can
  then be used by lofar_add_library() and lofar_add_executable() in
  LofarMacros.cmake. This avoids the need to create a "dummy" project library,
  solely to resolve all library dependencies on other packages when linking
  executables. 

* Define ${PROJECT_NAME}_INCLUDE_PATH_SUFFIX in LofarAddPackage.cmake.
  The user can then override the default value. There will be no need for
  caching anymore (as far as I can see).

* Create a symlink to each header file, instead of each directory containing 
  header files. 
  Advantages: 
  - you must explicitly mention each header file that is part of the
    package's interface.
  - Generated files (like the MAC protocol files) can be put in the 
    $bindir/include directory instead of $bindir/include/MAC directory.
  Disadvantages: 
  - a lot of symlinks.
  This could all be done using a macro like lofar_add_headers(). This macro
  would then create the directory 
  ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/include/${${PROJECT_NAME}_INCLUDE_PATH_SUFFIX}, when the 
  first symlink is created. Another options is to let LofarAddPackage handle
  this, but then a non-default include path suffix should be set before
  lofar_add_package() is called.

* SSE flags are not yet passed properly to either GNU or ICC compiler.
  Maybe this should just be done in the variants file when defining the
  different compiler suites and options.

* Turn makeversion into a real CMake macro and merge it with
  LofarPackageVersion. Generate the Package__Version.{h,cc} files in the
  binary directory, instead of the source directory.
