LCS/Tools package
=================

The LCS/Tools contains a collection of basic tools that can help the developer
doing his day to day tasks. Contrary to all other LOFAR packages, this package
does NOT produce a library. Instead, it is a collection of useful executables,
both binaries and scripts.

The current release contains the following useful executables:

LimitExec      : Limit the execution time of a program to a maximum.

lofarinit.sh   : Define the LOFAR environment for Bourne-like shells.

lofarinit.csh  : Define the LOFAR environment for C-like shells.

lofarcvsmv     : Move files or directories within the LOFAR CVS repository.

lofarcvsx      : Set or clear x-bit of files within the LOFAR CVS repository.

finddep        : Find the packages used by other packages.
                 Packages taken into account are all LOFAR packages and
                 external packages. Used by makedep.sh

pkgdep         : Generate dependency trees for all LOFAR packages.
                 pkgdep uses the output of finddep as input.
                 Used by makedep.sh

makedep.sh     : Generate dependency trees (uses and used-by) for LOFAR
                 packages and store result in html files. Uses finddep and
                 pkgdep.

makedoc        : Build the doxygen documentation for all packages in the
                 current directory and below.

makePackage.py : Create a new LOFAR package.
                 The script will create a skeleton configure.in file, a src and
                 test directory containing a skeleton Makefile.am; the new
                 package will be added to the lofarconf.in file.

makeClass.py   : Create a skeleton for a new class. 
                 The script produces a .h and .cc file. Furthermore, it adds
                 entries for these files in the Makefile.am

makeTest.py    : Create a skeleton for a test program.
                 The script will generate a .cc file, a .sh file, a .in and a
                 .out file
