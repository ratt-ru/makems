LCS/Tools: Version 1.3, date: 2006/01/30
========================================

No major changes have been made to the LCS/Tools package.


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 423 : Create a makedoc script for doxygen
        Added some fixes.

# 528 : makeClass does not work correctly
        There is a missing _ in the template for a normal .h file.
        Furthermore the template skeletons are generated by makeClass.py
        instead of being defined in a template file.
        Finally the check if a class exists fails if the class is templated,
        thus without .cc file.

# 596 : Remove all occurrences of nobase_ from all Makefile.am files
        Reason for banning the use of nobase_ is that automake will use
        install-sh instead of /usr/bin/install when installing nobase_ header
        files. Because install-sh does not support the -C option, the header
        files will always be copied to the installation directory, even if
        they haven't been modified. This will trigger a lot of useless
        compilations of dependent sources.



LCS/Tools: Version 1.2, date: 2005/11/16
========================================

In preparation of making package distributable as rpm package, all header
files that must be installed have been moved from the `src' directory to the
`inclucde/<package>' directory (ref. BugID #396).

Furthermore, some changes to the build environment require the use of
autoconf_share 2.4 (or later). 


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 350 : Add ability to move files in CVS 
        Make it possible to move files in the CVS repository, while keeping
        the CVS history.
        `lofarcvsmv' and `lofarcvsx' have been implemented and deployed.

# 420 : Move programs/scripts to derive package dependencies to LCS/Tools
        Moved the script makedep.sh and the C++ code pkgdep.cc to the
        LCS/Tools directory; updated Makefile.am.

# 423 : Create a makedoc script for doxygen
        A makedoc script would be very handy to build the doxygen
        documentation.  It avoids the need to configure, build, and install
        all software.
        New script `makedoc' has been added.

# 424 : make distcheck does not work 
        Remove the .tmp files during the install and added a uninstall-local
        target.

# 429 : Endless recusion in finddep 
        The result of finddep enters an endless loop which is only stopped
        because the output file gets too large.

# 445 : makedoc removes non-empty ./doc directory 
        Use directory doc/html and rename if existing. Added option to specify
        target directory. Try to find doxygen path in variants file. Use
        standard doxygen.cfg from autoconf_share. Made the script more
        flexible and robust.

# 455 : makedep does not work
        makedep.sh cannot find pkgdep anymore.  Furthermore it has to be run
        from the src directory.



LCS/Tools 1.1, 2005/09/02
