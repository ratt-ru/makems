LCS/Common: Version 3.0, date: 2006/01/30
=========================================

All Blob related stuff has been moved into the new LCS/Blob package.
Deprecated stuff -- Debug, Thread and Profiling -- has been removed.
Blitz support has been moved into the LCS/Math package.


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 146 : LofarLogger segfaults when used in statically initialized objects
        Created patch for log4cplus 1.0.2.

# 396 : Support of rpm builds
        Make it possibe to build an rpm from a package. Also support spec.in
        files in rub to find dependent packages.

# 420 : Move programs/scripts to derive package dependencies to LCS/Tools
        The script makedep.sh and the C++ code pkgdep.cc have both been moved
        to the LCS/Tools directory. The respective Makefile.am files have been
        updated as well.

# 500 : NSTimer doesn't have ostream& operator<<
        Made operator<< public. Added functions getElapsed and getCount

# 538 : Add alignment control to BlobField
        Added alignment argument to BlobField, BlobString and BlobArray
        functions.  Changed BlobArray such that alignment > 8 bytes is
        possible.

# 548 : Interupted accept call on socket is not repeated
        If the accept call returns EWOULDBLOCK, EAGAIN or EINTR the call is
        repeated.

# 556 : move blob to Blob
        Blob code moved to a separate package

# 557 : Remove all deprecated stuff
        The following stuff is deprecated and has been removed: Debug,
        Profiling, Thread and Blitz and some backward compatibility stuff
        (e.g. Net/backward).

# 596 : Remove all occurrences of nobase_ from all Makefile.am files
        Reason for banning the use of nobase_ is that automake will use
        install-sh instead of /usr/bin/install when installing nobase_ header
        files. Because install-sh does not support the -C option, the header
        files will always be copied to the installation directory, even if
        they haven't been modified. This will trigger a lot of useless
        compilations of dependent sources.

# 602 : Bit order incorrect in dataConvert
        The order of the bits in a byte should be swapped when converting
        to/from bools to make it the same as AIPS++.



LCS/Common: Version 2.4, date: 2005/11/16
=========================================

In preparation of making package distributable as rpm package, all header
files that must be installed have been moved from the `src' directory to the
`inclucde/<package>' directory (ref. BugID #396).

Furthermore, some changes to the build environment require the use of
autoconf_share 2.4 (or later). 


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 331 : make includefiles for boost.
        Added lofar_*.h files for Boost.Date_Time and Boost.Threads.

# 394 : Update documentation
        General updates to the Doxygen documentation, e.g., add missing
        Doxygen tags like \ingroup, \defgroup, and \addtogroup.

# 407 : lofar_datetime.h is not installed after "make install"
        Added lofar_datetime.h to Makefile.am

# 422 : Reading back AIPS++ array fails
        Reading back an AIPS++ array from a blob gives an invalid IPosition
        exception.

# 472 : ::shutdown() not implemented in BG/L
        The shutdown socket syscall is not implemented on Blue Gene/L. This is
        not critical, since a shutdown() is often followed by a close(), but
        it currently fills stderr with non-fatal failure messages. I propose
        having Socket::shutdown() always succeed on Blue Gene/L (I'll attach a
        patch shortly).

# 488 : ALLOC_TRACER_ALIAS does not work correctly without log4cplus
        There is a difference in the implementation of ALLOC_TRACER_ALIAS
        between LofarLogCout and LofarLog4Cplus. The method getLogger is
        public for Log4Cplus. For LogCout it is not defined if it is public,
        private or protected.



LCS/Common: Version 2.3, date: 2005/09/02
=========================================

The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

#  51 : Profile the BBS code and optimize as much as possible

        Added multi-threading support for i386 and x86_64 in Timer class.

# 173 : Deprecate Thread and Profiling in LCS

        Marked Thread.h and PerfProfile.h as deprecated.

# 225 : update polyphase filter

        Added timer support for PowerPC/BlueGene and PowerPC/Linux 
        with xlC and g++


# 239 : Add support for floating point comparison

        First pretty rough version of some numeric functions, e.g. floating
        point comparison using a "distance" measure.


# 270 : integration of TFlopCorrelator parts

        Added check to see if system call was interupted in Socket.cc


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER  70 : autoconf_share        : Track external dependencies

         clog cannot be used with PVSS

ER 161 : Common                : Place code in namespace LOFAR

         Added missing clog declaration.

ER 247 : Common                : Use builtin complex 

         Fixed collision between std::clog and clog()

ER 285 : ACC                   : Extend ACC with array support

         Upgrade ACC 1.0 to 1.1 ParameterSet is now in ACC/APS.  
         ProceControl is now in ACC/PLC.  
         ParameterSet getInt changed to getInt32.



LCS/Common: Version 2.2, date: 2005/06/15
=========================================


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER 220 : Build environment     : Compile on 64 bit machine 

         Code has been modified in order to compiler properly on 64 bit
         machines, like AMD Opterons.

ER 236 : LOFAR SW development  : preparations for Package documentation 

         The documentation of each LOFAR package should be put into a separate
         Doxygen group (or module). This makes the documentation more
         accessible and offers a way to quickly browse to different packages.
         Preparations have been made for several packages, including
         LCS/Common.

ER 247 : Common                : Use builtin complex 

         The GNU compiler suite comes with a builtin complex type. Whenever
         possible this builtin type will be used, because performance almost
         triples compared to the std::complex type.

ER 252 : Build environment     : Add 'limit exec' to runtest.sh

         Some test programs occasionally "hang" waiting for a mutex lock, or
         in a blocking I/O operation. In order to not hamper a (system) build
         these suspicious programs should be killed after a predefined
         run-time. This feature has been added to runtest.sh /
         assay. Currently, it will not work when a .run file is used.


The following Problem Reports have been fixed
---------------------------------------------

PR 100 : LOFAR SW development  : Neither config.h nor lofar_config.h should
                                 be included in header files

         Inclusion of either config.h or lofar_config.h in a distributed
         header file is problematic, because the config files themselves
         cannot be distributed; they contain system specific definitions. It
         is therefore unwise to include either of these files in a header
         file.

         Note: This Problem Report is closely related to Enhancement Request
               ER 229.
