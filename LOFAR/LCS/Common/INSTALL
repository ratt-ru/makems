Building a LOFAR package
========================

The LOFAR build environment is built upon the GNU AutoTools. It adds support
for easily building multiple variants (e.g. different compilers, optimized or
non-optimized, with MPI support, etc.). 

From the user's perspective there are two important differences:
  1. use `lofarconf' instead of `configure'
  2. call `lofarconf' from a build directory.

For example, suppose you want to build the current package using the default
GNU compiler generating optimized code. You would then do the following:

  1. Change directory to the package root directory (i.e. LCS/Common).
  2. Issue the `./bootstrap' command.
  3. Create a build/<variant> directory (i.e. mkdir -p build/gnu_opt)
     and change to that directory.
  4. Issue the `../../lofarconf' command.
  5. Issue the commands `make', `make check' [optional], and `make install'.

By default, `make install' will do an install in the directory
`install/<variant>' relative to the LOFAR root directory
(e.g. $HOME/LOFAR/install/gnu_opt).
