autoconf_share: Version 2.5, date: 2005/01/30
=============================================

Support for building rpm packages has now been completed. `rub' now supports
extra command line options `-release', `-rpm', `-distcheck', `-j', and
`-checktool'. Several bug fixes and enhancements have been made.


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 352 : Add check for support of "install -C"
        Renamed macro lofar_PROG_BSD_INSTALL to
        lofar_CHECK_INSTALL_IF_MODIFIED and added check for -C option for the
        install-sh script

# 396 : Support of rpm builds
        Made it possibe to build an rpm from a package. Also support spec.in
        files in rub to find dependent packages.
        - Added option -release, -rpm, -distcheck
        - Make it a two-step check out; first determine which version to use,
          thereafter check out everything.
        - Support of requires lines in rpm .spec.in files

# 423 : Create a makedoc script for doxygen
        A makedoc script has been created. It avoids the need to configure,
        build, and install all software.

# 504 : added -j and -checktool option
        Add the -j option to make parallel makes possible.  
        Add -checktool to be able to use tools like valgrind in make check.

# 516 : AIPS++ needs WCS
        Added --with-wcs
        WCS has been added to the -l list of AIPS++.

# 529 : log rub commandline in rub.log
        The command is now listed at the top of rub.log.

# 543 : g++ should warn when hiding virtual method in base class
        Added warning flag for overloading virtual functions.

# 550 : lofarconf --with-lofar does not work as documented
        Patched lofar_init.m4. Weekly builds should now be installed in
        /data/LOFAR/installed weekly.

# 558 : make rpm does not work
        The configure done in make rpm failed to find the correct log4cplus,
        pqxx, etc. This has been fixed.

# 591 : checkfloat not found
        When doing make check, assay did not find the checkfloat script. Fixed.

# 599 : Timba build fails
        Fixed bug in lofar_package.m4.



autoconf_share: Version 2.4, date: 2005/11/16
=============================================

In preparation of making packages distributable as rpm package, changes were
made to the build environment which are not backward compatible. In short,
this means that new package releases will require at least version 2.4 of this
package.


The following BugIDs have been resolved
---------------------------------------

# 271 : Add / Remove packages to weekly builds 
        All doxygen related .doc files were renamed to .dox

# 322 : Replace API_ROOT in lofar_pvss.m4 with /opt/pvss/pvss2_v3... 
        Since PVSS will always be installed in the same directory (/opt/pvss/)
        and the usage of env. var. is discouraged, it is recommended to use a
        hard coded path (/opt/pvss/pvss2_v3.0/api/include) in the
        lofar_pvss.m4 in autoconf_share instead of the used API_ROOT env.

# 352 : Add check for support of "install -C" 
        Added the macro lofar_PROG_BSD_INSTALL which checks whether the
        command line option -C is supported or not. If it is supported, then
        it is added to the definition of the environment variable INSTALL.

# 421 : make testprograms without executing 
        Added rule alltest to make all test programs

        

autoconf_share: Version 2.3, date: 2005/09/02
=============================================


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER  70 : autoconf_share         : Track external dependencies 

         rub now does an install by  default when doing a build.
         Extra m4 macros for RPM support were added.
         Minor changes in variant files.

ER 127 : autoconf_share         : Add rules for BG/L compiler

         Removed suppression of compiler warnings.



autoconf_share: Version 2.2, date: 2005/06/16
=============================================


The following Enhancement Requests have been implemented
--------------------------------------------------------

ER  70 : autoconf_share         : Track external dependencies 

         Several improvements to rub. E.g., rub can now do a system build
         exactly like the "old" global Makefile. Added a couple of switches.
         Added extensive online help.

ER 220 : Build environment      : Compile on 64 bit machine 

         Variants files for two Itanium systems have been added

ER 236 : LOFAR SW development   : preparations for Package documentation

         The `dot' utility is now used by default for Doxygen, producing much
         nicer diagrams.

ER 248 : Build environment      : Support SSE instructions 

         Use SSE2 instructions whenever possible.

ER 252 : Build environment      : Add 'limit exec' to runtest.sh 

         Added a `limit exec' functionality to assay and
         runtest.sh. Implemented limitexec.sh, a "poor man's" LimitExec, that
         will be used as a fallback. Currently, .run are not started under
         `limit exec' supervision.

ER 275 : Build environment      : XLC variants 

         Added support for Blue Gene cross compiler.
