autoconf_share
==============

The contents of this package can roughly be split into three parts:

* A collection of LOFAR specific m4 macros that are used by the GNU AutoTools,
  e.g., autoconf.

* A collection of shell scripts that are used for building and/or testing
  LOFAR software packages.

* A collection of so-called variant files that contains system-specific
  definitions; e.g., the (non-standard) location of a compiler, or
  system-specific compiler switches.
